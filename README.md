# N-able Assessment

This is my submission to the assigned N-able Coding assessment via a Figma design.

I decided to create this assignment in two seperate ways. The first way being in plain HTML,CSS, and vanilla Javascript files. These files are located under the "Plain_files" folder in the master branch. The second form of the assignment was done in the React.js framework. This was done to show a simple react app build and to create reusable components. The React app can be found in the "n_able_codingassessment" folder in the master branch.

To start the React app, download the files and run a "npm start" command in the command line.

In the React app I added two buttons to toggle between the two pages rendered on screen. This was done to reuse components and render a single page app. This can be seen in the GIF below.

An additional "back" button was added at the top of the screen to transition back to the toggle button and preview another page. This button is outside of the design specifications, but felt necessary for easy viewing. The "back" buttons were removed in the plain HTML files.


all files are designed for the sopecific screen sizes of 1728px X 907px for desktop, and 390px X 844px for mobile.
